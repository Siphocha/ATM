# ATM in C!

C is a very low-level programming language. A such alot of institutions use it continuously.
A great example of this re financial institutions. They generally utilise C to a high degree.
Why? Because of memory safety and specificity. C being explicit about integers and finiky about memory loss is excellent.

This program is my attempt at basic ATM functionality through C.
Aka: Check balance, withdraw, add to balance and done.

The program can be ran by doing "(in whichever directory): gcc ATM.c -o ATM.exe" then after do the command "./ATM.exe".
This will allow you to use the program through the command prompt.

This project was interesitng because it especially taught me the way in which functions are handled in C. The numerous declarations and pointers to them.
It gave me an appreciation for procedural languages... So annoyingly orderly.
